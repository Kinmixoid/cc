# Technical Test for Lead Developer Role

## 1. Project Brief

Our client requires a booking platform for their website. They would like the following functionality:

- They would like users to be able to choose an appointment type
- The user should then be presented with a list of available dates / times
- The user should then be able to choose an appointment and proceed to book by providing their name and email address
- Once booked, the client should receive a notification
- The client should be able to manage appointment types and dates / times within their CMS

## 2. Technical Specification Document

Please write a short technical specification document that includes:

- **System Architecture**: High-level overview of the proposed solution.
- **Technology Stack**: Justification for choosing Laravel and any other technologies.
- **Database Schema**: Entities, relationships, and key attributes.
- **Security Considerations**: How they plan to secure the application.
- **Performance Considerations**: How they plan to ensure the application scales well.

## 3. Implementation Task

Based on the technical specification, implement a key feature or set of features. This could involve:

- Implementing the booking logic with validation and error handling.
- Commenting in the code base where functionality should be added and provide code examples

Please note, this does not need to be a fully working solution with a CMS. We are looking for the chosen approach and code snippets, any functionality that is working is a bonus but not essential.

## 4. Code Review and Documentation

Please fork the public repository and provide a link to your own completed test.

## 5. Evaluation Criteria

The test will be judged on the following criteria

- **Documentation**: Clarity and thoroughness of the technical specification and code documentation.
- **Code Quality**: Provided code adheres to PHP best practices and makes use of the Laravel framework
- **Security**: Implementation of security best practices.
- **Performance**: Efficient database and application design.
